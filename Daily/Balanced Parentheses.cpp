Question - BALANCED PARENTHESES

  A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: (, ), {, }, [, or ].
  Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket (i.e., (, [, or {) occurs to the left of a closing bracket (i.e., ), ], or }) of the 
  exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: [], {}, and ().
  A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses are not matched. 
  For example, {[(])} is not balanced because the contents in between { and } are not balanced. 
  The pair of square brackets encloses a single, unbalanced opening bracket, (, and the pair of parentheses encloses a single, unbalanced closing square bracket, ].
  By this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is balanced if the following conditions are met:
  (i) It contains no unmatched brackets.
  (ii) The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is also a matched pair of brackets.

Given n strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced. If a string is balanced, return YES. Otherwise, return NO.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^3
1 <= |s| <= 10^3, where |s| is the length of the sequence.
All characters in the sequences âˆˆ { {, }, (, ), [, ] }.
